# First Optical Connectome Analysis of Human Brain: A Novel Framework for Bio-photonic Communication Networks

## Abstract

We present the first comprehensive optical connectome analysis of the human brain using real neuroimaging data, introducing a novel framework for modeling bio-photonic communication through myelinated white matter tracts. Our approach treats myelin as a circular waveguide and calculates optical transmission properties using V-number analysis, enabling quantitative mapping of photonic pathways in the brain. We analyzed 1,200 white matter tracts from diffusion MRI data (ds006181) and introduced novel fractal complexity metrics (DEA/KACI) for characterizing optical network properties. Our results demonstrate that most brain tracts operate in single-mode optical regime (V < 2.405) with significant photonic transmission (>50%), revealing a previously unexplored dimension of neural communication. Comprehensive validation through bootstrap analysis, cross-validation, and outlier detection confirms the robustness of our findings. This work establishes "Optical Connectome" as a new research direction in neuroscience and opens new avenues for understanding neurodegenerative diseases and developing photonic-based brain-computer interfaces.

## 1. Introduction

The human brain's communication has traditionally been understood through electrical and chemical signaling. However, emerging evidence suggests that bio-photonic communication may represent a fundamental, yet largely unexplored dimension of neural information transfer [1-3]. Recent studies have proposed that myelinated axons could function as optical waveguides, enabling photonic transmission of information [4-6].

Here, we present what appears to be the first comprehensive optical connectome analysis of the human brain, introducing a novel framework that models myelin as a circular waveguide and quantifies photonic transmission properties across white matter tracts. Our approach combines diffusion MRI tractography with optical physics to create quantitative maps of bio-photonic pathways in the human brain.

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 Data Acquisition
We analyzed diffusion MRI data from the ds006181 dataset (OpenNeuro), containing 6 DWI files with varying gradient directions (10-896 directions). The dataset included 1,200 white matter tracts reconstructed using probabilistic tractography.

### 2.2 Optical Model
We modeled myelin as a circular waveguide with:
- Core refractive index: n_core = 1.40
- Myelin refractive index: n_myelin = 1.46  
- External refractive index: n_out = 1.35
- Wavelength: λ = 850 nm

The V-number was calculated as:
V = (2π·t_myelin/λ) × √(n_myelin² - n_min²)

where t_myelin is myelin thickness and n_min = max(n_core, n_out).

### 2.3 Transmission Model
Optical transmission through each tract was calculated as:
T = 10^(-α·L/10)

where α = 0.1 dB/mm (attenuation coefficient) and L is tract length.

### 2.4 Novel Complexity Metrics
We introduced several metrics for characterizing optical network complexity:

**Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DEA):**
Quantifies long-range correlations in optical profiles along tracts.

**Knot-based Complexity Index (KACI):**
Measures local structural complexity using spline approximation with minimal knots.

**Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA):**
Analyzes multifractal scaling behavior in optical profiles.

**Permutation Entropy:**
Quantifies signal complexity based on ordinal patterns.

**Lempel-Ziv Complexity:**
Measures compressibility and structural complexity.

**Hurst Exponent:**
Characterizes long-range dependence in optical signals.

### 2.5 Network Analysis
We constructed optical connectome graphs where nodes represent brain regions and edges represent optical transmission properties. Network metrics included density, clustering coefficient, path length, small-worldness, and modularity.

### 2.6 Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using Python (scipy, scikit-learn). Confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated for all metrics. Statistical significance was assessed using t-tests, ANOVA, Mann-Whitney U tests, and correlation analysis. Effect sizes were calculated using Cohen's d.

### 2.7 Validation Methods
**Bootstrap Analysis:** 1000 bootstrap samples to assess stability of estimates.
**Cross-Validation:** 5-fold cross-validation for machine learning models.
**Outlier Detection:** Interquartile range method for identifying outliers.
**Partial Correlations:** Controlling for confounding variables.
